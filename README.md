# IaC Scripts for Nightworkers Labs
Automatize infrastructure installation.
Losely based on kubespray repo default params (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray)
Ansible directory layout follows best practices (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout).

## How-To use (on server)
### Recommanded
Using VSCode is recommanded.
- Connect to remote server using `ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh` extension. 
  - Configure any `.ssh/config` / `ssh_config` file with your server parameters set to it, with something like :
    ```
    Host whatever.hello.com
    HostName whatever.hello.com
    Port 1638
    User my_user
    ForwardAgent yes # Allows any local-machine Github credentials to be forwarded
    AddKeysToAgent yes # Allows any local-machine Github credentials to be forwarded
    UseKeychain yes # Allows any local-machine Github credentials to be forwarded
    IdentityFile  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # REQUIRED if wanting a passwordless connection, see below.
    ```
    - To get rid of passwords at connection, you might want to use SSH keys instead. To do so, on your local machine's terminal, run : 
        - `ssh-keygen`, Generate a brand new SSH private-public keypair. You'll need to copy the generated file's path to your `.ssh/config` / `ssh_config` `IdentityFile` parameters.
        - `ssh-copy-id -p <SSH_PORT> <user>@<domain>`, copies previously generated pubkey to `<user>`'s `.ssh/authorized_keys`, allowing connection without password.
    - You might want to use a custom `ssh_config` file stored on OneDrive / Google Drive. You'll need to configure `remote.SSH.configFile` extension parameter with the cloud stored file's path on your local machine for it to work (eg., `/Users/guillaumevara/Mon Drive/ssh/ssh_config`).

Make sure you are locally logged on `git` w/ a registered account using :
  - keychain-like features of your OS
  - having your local Github SSH keys agent-forwarded through `ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh` as this documentation recommands, and obviously configured on your own GitHub account.

### Startup
- `git clone {this repo}`
- Launch VSCode Task `‚õè Install Ansible requirements`
- Launch VSCode Task `Install Ansible dev-tools`
- Launch VSCode Task `Install kubespray requirements`
- Define `./ansible/inventories/group_vars/all/vault` passwords and tokens as defined in `./ansible/inventories/group_vars/all/vars`
- Encrypt `./ansible/inventories/group_vars/all/vault` using `ansible-vault encrypt ansible/inventories/production/group_vars/all/vault`
- Fill `./ansible-vault-pw` file with previously set encrypting password
- Optional: You might want to opt-out of certain services by commenting roles within `./ansible/playbooks/site.yml`
- Launch VSCode Task `üöÄ Install whole site !`

### How to upgrade from latest kubespray
- Launch VSCode Task `‚õèüîÑ Upgrade Ansible requirements`
- Compare `./requirements.txt`, `./ansible/inventories/production*` with kubespray's repo (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/tree/master/inventory/sample/group_vars) and merge accordingly
